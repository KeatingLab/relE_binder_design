from my notes

scoreBinders
	- 2 just a copy for debugging
	- 3 scoring a with single structure in the seed file. Almost recapitulates the older results, just off by 3 energy units
	- 4 score same fusedDB bb as if they were complexes
	- 5 make a fresh interfacescorer everytime when scoring seeds
	- 6 show that if everything has the same length there's no issue (second two designs)

simple_batching is where I verified that it works without the batching
